# Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to create a simple Python password generator. This generator will take the user's input for minimum length, presence of numbers, and presence of special characters, and generate a password that meets the criteria.

# How to Run 

To run this script, clone the repository and run the password_generator.py file using Python.

# Implementation 

The script uses the string library to define the sets of characters that can be used in the password. The generate_password function takes the user's input for the minimum length, presence of numbers, and presence of special characters, and generates a password using these criteria.

# Potential Improvements 

The code provided here can be further improved by adding additional features such as password strength estimation, user-defined password complexity, and support for password management features.

# Conclusion 

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of a password generator in Python. It serves as a starting point for anyone interested in exploring this topic further. Keep in mind that the code provided here is for educational purposes only, and using it for any malicious purposes is strictly prohibited.
